Files for the server

Github doesnt like it when I try to put mongo stuff here,
so you should put your mongo database files into their own
folder.

to connect to test file use:
http://localhost:8080/

The music files should be in a Server/audio/*STATIONNAME*/ folder
where the Server folder is the folder that server.js is in
